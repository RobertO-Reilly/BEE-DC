Hello!

This R script was written by James Dorey, starting on the 2nd of May 2022. The script intends to clean occurrence data from several sources using a combination of custom functions and functions from the “bdc” package. The script was then adapted to RMD and HTML website by Robert O'Reilly.

For queries, please feel free to contact James Dorey at jbdorey@me.com
